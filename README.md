## Weather-Dashboard

## Description

For this assignment I was to create a weather dashboard. This site works by allowing the user to search a city to get the current weather and 5-day forecast. The search history stays after the user refreshes the page, but there is also a clear history button if the user would like to start a new search history. I used an API key from https://openweathermap.org/api to get the forecast information I needed. There was a lot of googling involved to get everything to work, but I feel I am getting better at JavaScript but still have much to learn.
